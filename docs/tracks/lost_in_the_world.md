## Lyrics
[Justin Vernon:]
>I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
>I'm building a still to slow down the time
>I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
>I'm building a still to slow down the time
>I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
>I'm building a still, down the time

>[Kanye West and Justin Vernon:]
>I'm lost in the world, been down my whole life
>I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night
>Down for the night, said she's down for the night
>Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
>Ooh, ooh, ooh (Slow down the time), ooh
>I'm lost in the world, been down my whole life
>I'm new in the city, but I'm down for the night
>Down for the night, down for the night

[Kanye West:]
>You're my devil, you're my angel
>You're my heaven, you're my hell
>You're my now, you're my forever
>You're my freedom, you're my jail
>You're my lies, you're my truth
>You're my war, you're my truce
>You're my questions, you're my proof
>You're my stress and you're my masseuse
>Ma-ma-se, ma-ma-se, ma-ma-ku-sa
>Lost in this plastic life
>Let's break out of this fake-ass party
>Turn this into a classic night
>If we die in each other's arms
>Still get laid in the afterlife
>If we die in each other's arms
>Still get laid, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Kanye West and Elly Jackson:]
>Run from the lights, run from the night, run for your life
>Down for the night, down for the night, down for the night

[Kanye West:]
>I'm lost in the world, been down my whole life
>I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night
>Down for the night, down for the night

[Gil Scott Heron and Kanye West:]
>Who will survive in America?
>Who will survive in America? (Down for the night)
>Who will survive in America?
>Who will survive in America?

[Kanye West:]
>I'm lost in the world, been down my whole life
>I'm new in the city
>And I'm down for the night, down for the night
>I'm lost in the world, been down my whole life
>I'm new in the city
>But I'm down for the night, down for a night
>Oh-oh, get down
